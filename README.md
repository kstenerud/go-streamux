Streamux
========

A Go implementation of the [Streamux](https://github.com/kstenerud/streamux) protocol.

Streamux is designed as a low level, point-to-point, bidirectional protocol for you to build a messaging layer on top of. It handles the nitty gritty things like initialization, multiplexing, asynchronous operation, and packetization of your messages.
